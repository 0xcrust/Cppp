 * This chapter does not say what happens when you run out of memory
 * using new . Thatâ€™s called memory exhaustion. Find out what happens. You have
 * two obvious alternatives: look for documentation, or write a program with
 * an infinite loop that allocates but never deallocates. Try both. Approxi-
 * mately how much memory did you manage to allocate before failing?

I ran this experiment on an hp pavilion 14 and got as far as 1,369,801 loops before
a crash. Doing the math (multiplied by 500,000 bytes for each allocation), that gives
684,900,500,000 bytes(684,900,500 kilobytes).
